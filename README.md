# Django Feather

A simple Tag (`{% icon "name" %}`) to implement [Feather Icons](https://feathericons.com) in Django.

## Install
Install `django-feather` using `pip` and put it into your `INSTALLED_APPS`:
```bash
pip install django-feather
```  
`settings.py`:
```python
INSTALLED_APPS = [
    # ...
    'django_feather',
    # ...
]
```

## Usage
After installation, the tag can be used just like any other tag:

```djangotemplate
{% load icon %}

<p>Using a string {% icon "coffee" class="css-class" height="8" width="8" %}</p>
<p>Using a variable {% icon self.icon class="css-class" height="8" width="8" %}</p>

```

The `icon` tag will simply take the SVG source from the Feather project,
apply additional attributes and return the SVG tag.

## Performance
`django-feather` does not read the `.svg` files each time an icon is rendered.
Instead, all the icons are written to a `.py` file upon build, just like the JavaScript
library.  
However, other than the JavaScript library, icons are rendered on the server side.
This avoids having to call `feather.replace()` after the page has loaded.
